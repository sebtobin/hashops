# Polymorphic Hash Table Implementation in C

Polymorphic hashtable implementation in C, with create, insert, lookup, delete and free operations. Uses linked list chaining for collision handling. No prevention for the insertion of duplicate data. Insert, lookup and delete all take void* data as a parameter, rather than a <key, pair> implementation.
